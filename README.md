Coursera Final Project

This is a repo for the Getting and Cleaning Data Week 4 Project on Coursera. The repo contains everything needed for the assignment: R code, a codebook, and a tidy data set.

Files : CodeBook.MD describes how to use everything. It also descibes the data, variables, and transformations to clean the data.

Final Project.R contains the code to perform the transformation on the data. This code can be used in RStudio.

tidyData.txt is the output of the R script.
